有些人头部相连、有些人身体相连等，探讨其中对人格同一性、自由意志、身体、财产权等的观念，不同类型的连体人之间类似于种族问题的差异、分歧、可能存在的歧视以及隔离等现象

镜像双胞胎
最著名的案例是格蕾塔·卓别林 (Greta Chaplin) 和芙蕾达·卓别林 (Freda Chaplin) 的案例，她们于 20 世纪 70 年代在英国曝光。涉及两个身体，但这些身体的行为方式至少与跨越它们的统一意识的单一实例是兼容的。每个身体都可以完成由另一个身体开始的复杂且不可预测的句子。两人一起做了所有能做的事情。当距离超过几米时，他们痛苦地抱怨，每个尸体都报告说感觉自己的一部分被撕掉了。等等。遗憾的是，尚未找到对此案的专业讨论，但当时的媒体对此进行了广泛报道，例如《时代》杂志，1981 年 4 月 6 日。（SEP, the Unity of Consciousness）

There are 15 categories, though many twins don’t fit perfectly within any of  the  classifications. 
For  more  medical  information  regarding  conjoined  twins  see www.umm.edu/conjoined_twins/facts.htm  and www.phreeque.com/conjoined_twins.html. 

a ‘parasitic’ Siamese twin
Alice Dreger Domurat, "The limits of individuality: ritual and sacrifice in the lives and medical treatment of conjoined twins." Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 29, no. 1 (1998): 1.the medical team is overly obsessed with surgery which is supported by strong cultural projections about what it is to be a person and sometimes works in contradiction to the welfare of the Siamese twins.

who owns the body if it is under the control of two wills? 
Is it even intelligible to consider property under duel ownership of two wills? 
Are there limits of a dominant twin based on the demands of the  other  twin? :
- Only  the  dominant  twin  would  be controlling  the  muscular  movements  of  the  two  of  them
- It is also possible to define this characteristic  relatively:  one  twin  controls  the  body  to  a  greater  (but  not  total) degree than the other, e.g. the dominant twin controls the body inhabited by both of them 60%, and  the  weak  brother  40%. 
Could  one  twin  commit  a  crime  while  the  other  was innocent?  
What,  if  any,  are  the  limits  of  restitution  and  punishment regarding conjoined twins? 
- one entirely  innocent
- both  are guilty, but to different degrees
.Is it possible for the conjoined twins to pay  in  proportion  to  their  separate  contribution  to  the  crime?  For example,  a  monetary  penalty  may  be  divided  among  various  bank accounts. Of  course, it would be difficult to determine how a submissive twin  could have  access to  his  own  money  if  he  is  physically  unable  to provide  information  and  sign  documentation. 
.compensation to the the  weaker or coerced one.providing  as  much  comfort  as  possible  to  the innocent, submissive twin
Could one twin legally end his life if it meant the  end  of  both  of  their  lives?  
Could  one  twin  enter  into  a  contract without the consent of the other

Four  year  old  Tatiana and  Krista of  Vernon, B.C.,  Canada,  are  not just conjoined, but are also “craniopagus, sharing a skull and also a bridge between  each  girl’s  thalamus,  a  part  of  the  brain  that  processes  and relays sensory information to other parts of the brain. Or perhaps in this case,  to both  brains. There  is  evidence  that they  can see  through each other’s eyes and perhaps share each other’s unspoken thoughts.”
