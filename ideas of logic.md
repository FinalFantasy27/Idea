. Suppose a girl (call her Lily) says this, "Lily won't know if you don't tell Lily you want to kiss her, oh." However, only when she knows you want to kiss her (or probably want to kiss her) will she say this. 
This can be analyzed with Grice's cooperative principle: if someone says something that does not follow the cooperative principle, then you can tell that she may be trying to say something else (e.g. as is the case with irony). Here Lily actually wants you to express that you want to kiss her and to kiss her.
It would be interesting to see alternative explanations for this phenomenon and how to analyze the case using epistemic logic.
假设一个名叫Lily的女孩说了这句话，“不告诉Lily你想要亲吻她的话，Lily是不会知道的哦。”然而，只有当她知道你想要吻她（或你很可能想要吻她）的时候她才会说这句话。
这可以用格莱斯的会话合作原则来分析：如果某个人的某一句话不遵守会话合作原则，那么你可以判断她可能是想表达别的意思（例如反讽就是这样的情况）。这里Lily实际上是想要你表达出你想吻她和吻她。
这一现象的别种解释和如何用知识逻辑分析这一情况，将会是有意思的话题。

. words and actions don't match makes us feel contradictory but it's not a contradiction in the sense of formal logic. Let □ stands for "did ......" and ◇ stands for "said ......". "and ◇ stands for "said ......", it could be formalized as □A∧◇¬A. It would be interesting to treat it as a "true contradiction" and analyze it using paraconsistent logic. 
言行不一致表面上给我们一种“矛盾”的感觉，而实际上又不矛盾（在形式逻辑的意义上），令□代表“做了……”，◇代表“说了……”，可以形式化如下：□A∧◇¬A。将这真的当作一种“矛盾”并与次协调逻辑的结合，将会是有趣的话题。
