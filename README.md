# Ideas
A record of ideas but that I don't intend to realize(or don't have time to realize for a while). Anyone is welcome to join in and refine these ideas or realize them, and put forward your own.

# How to join in

### Step 0:
[Check the existing issues](https://github.com/FinalFantasy27/Ideas/issues) to see if everyone else has already started your desired ideas. If someone already started, go help them! :) If you want to put forward your ideas, please email me or make a pull request to let me know.

### Step 1:
[Make a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on Github!

### ......

### Step 3:
Your work is DONE! Now you just need to put it online. You can follow [Github Pages's instructions](https://pages.github.com/) for free hosting.

### Step 4: TELL ME YOU ARE DONE 
Email me so I know you're done!(I'm usually busy and/or bad at email, so it'll take me a while to get around to it, but if I don't respond for a week, ping me again!)
Make a Pull Request! (I am slow to respond, so you may have to wait a while before your work is live)

Thank you!
