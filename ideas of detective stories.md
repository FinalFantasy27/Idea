1. There may be more than one murderer, like a donut over another donut, and this other donut that is over another donut, etc.
凶手可能不止一个，就像一个甜甜圈套着另一个甜甜圈，套着另一个甜甜圈，如此反复……

2. A detective novel in which everyone says he or she is the murderer, may be due to misunderstanding, a person mistakenly thinks he or she is the murderer, just like a doughnut is empty in the middle and there is nothing there; or it may be due to warmth.
一部每个人都说ta自己是凶手的推理小说，可能是出于误解，就像甜甜圈中间是空的，什么也没有一样；也可能是因为温情。

3.在案件发生前就破案
